Integrations Program
============================================================
 
Mattermostâ€™s Integrations Program helps IT administrators, developers, and end users integrate Mattermost to hundreds of applications or create their own "micro-apps" extending existing open source integrations. You may also work with the Mattermost developer tool kit including full access to Mattermost RESTful APIs, drivers, webhooks, slash commands, and command line interface.

This is an optional program for third-party developers to increase awareness about their work and to enable Mattermost to refer its communities to different integrations.

Any person or any company interested in discussing third-party integrations with Mattermost can join the `Integrations and Apps discussion channel <https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/integrations>`_ on the Mattermost community server to speak to peers and Mattermost community managers.

Integrations are listed in our `App Directory <https://about.mattermost.com/default-app-directory/>`_ and recognized by Mattermost at three levels:

1. Community Integrations: Typically from the open source community who let us know about their work. The work is included in `the app directory <https://about.mattermost.com/default-app-directory/>`_ and may be highlighted in release announces or on social media as a benefit to the user and customer communities.

2. Registered Integrations: Meets all the requirements of Community Integrations, with the addition that they are actively maintained following Mattermost guidelines with links to official documentation, supporting branding guidelines, and maintaining a changelog. This level of engagement allows Mattermost to internally review and more prominently promote the work, knowing that it's committed to meeting explicit standards.

3. Certified Integrations: Meets all the requirements of Registered Integrations, with the addition that they are thoroughly tested by a Mattermost staff member and included as a built-in plugin. This program is currently under development as part of the Mattermost developer toolkit` <https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/toolkit.html>`_.
