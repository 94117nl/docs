Mattermost Documentation 
========================

Hosted at docs.mattermost.com, Mattermost Documentation is jointly developed by our community and Mattermost, Inc. to accelerate the adoption of Mattermost software based on the following goals and principles: 

Goal
----

Increase Mattermost usage through more numerous and larger deployments via  timely, effective, easy-to-find documentation delivered by talented people from community and Mattermost, Inc. who are attracted, trained, engaged and celebrated through our processes.

Principles
----------

Situation Awareness 

- Everyone involved with the documentation process should be aware of relevant processes, criteria and timelines. It's okay for processes to take time, it's not okay to leave contributors in the dark. 

Shared Responsibility 

- People approving PRs have a shared responsibility for its success and accurancy. Reviewers may be asked to make corrections in future, if PR authors are not available. 

Appropriate Review 

- Reviews of PRs should be specific PR needs (e.g. grammar, testing verification, technical review, etc.) and be conducted by reviewers skilled in those review areas. 

Acknowledgement 

- Contributors and reviewers should be acknowledged for their short term and long term contributions. 

Trust but Verify 

- Trust everyone to have the right intentions, spot check to find blindspots.
