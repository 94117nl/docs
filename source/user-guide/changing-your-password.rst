Changing Your Password
======================

If you sign in with a username and password, you can use Mattermost to change your password. If your organization has set up an alternate sign in method, you cannot use Mattermost to change your password.

**To change your password**:

1. Click your username, which is at the top of the navigation panel. In the menu that opens, click **Account Settings**.
2. Click **Security > Password**.
  .. note::
    If the Password field is not editable, then you cannot use Mattermost to change your password. See your System Administrator for instructions on how to change your password.
3. Enter your current password and new password information, then click **Save**.

The next time that you are asked to sign into Mattermost, use your new password.
