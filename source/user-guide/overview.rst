Teams
-----

In most cases, there is only one team on a Mattermost server, but multiple teams are allowed. A team's channels are visible only to the members of that team.

Two public channels are created when a team is created. All members of the team are automatically added to the two channels. One is called Town Square, and the other is called Off-Topic. The System Administrator can rename those two channels. You cannot leave the Town Square channel.

Public Channels
---------------

Team members have access to all public channels in that team. When joining the team, they are automatically added to the Town Square channel and the Off-Topic channel. Team members can add themselves to any public channel in their team.

Private Groups
--------------

Private groups are channels that are invite-only. The conversations are visible only to the channel members.

Direct Messages and Group Messages
----------------------------------

Direct Messages are for conversations between two people. Group Messages are Direct Messages that have conversations among three or more people. Both are visible only to the people involved.

Use a Direct Message when you want a private conversation with one other person. Use a Group Message when you want to quickly set up a conversation with up to seven other participants. If you want more than that, you must create a Private Group.

If your System Administrator has allowed it, you can start a Direct Message or a Group Message with people on other teams, not just your own.
