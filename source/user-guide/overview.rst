Teams
-----

In most cases, only one team.
if multiple teams, they're listed along the left of the window
each team has its own separate list of channels

two channels are created when the team is created. all members of the team are automatically added to the two channels. One is called Town Square, and the other Off-Topic. Administrator can rename those two channels. You cannot leave the Town Square channel.

Public Channels
---------------

Team members have access to all channels. When joining the team, they are automatically added to the Town Square channel and the Off-Topic channel. You can add yourself to any channel [link: see how]

Private Groups
--------------

Private groups are channels that are invite-only. The conversations are visible only to the channel members.

Direct Messages and Group Messages
----------------------------------

Direct Messages are for conversations between two people. Group Messages are Direct Messages that have conversations among three or more people. Both are visible only to the people involved.

Use a Direct Message when you want a private conversation with one other person. Use a Group Message when you want to quickly set up a conversation with up to seven other participants. If you want more than that, you must create a Private Group.

If your System Administrator has allowed it, you can start a Direct Message or a Group Message with people on other teams, not just your own.
